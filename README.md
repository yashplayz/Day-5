# Day-5

- I performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Train dataset using Python libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. The goal was to uncover key patterns and relationships that influenced survival.

- Survival Rate: Majority of passengers did not survive. Females and 1st class passengers had a significantly higher survival rate.

- Gender Impact: Most survivors were females, showing the “women and children first” policy was followed.

- Class & Fare: Higher-class passengers who paid higher fares had better survival chances.

- Age Factor: Most passengers were aged 20–40. Children had higher survival chances compared to adults.

- Embarkation: Passengers from Cherbourg (C) had better survival outcomes than those from other ports.

- Correlation: Positive correlation between Fare and Survived, and negative correlation with Pclass.
